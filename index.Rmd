This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
rm(list = ls())

library(rio)
library(ggplot2)
library(DescTools)

Link = "https://github.com/Highhighhand/Deliverable-1/raw/main/LifeExpect_birth.xlsx"
cia = import(Link)

```
First of all, we insert the data into R studio. We choose the Life expect data. And we want to make a histogram plot to visualize the life expectancy. 
```
```{r}
WIDTH=1

base= ggplot(cia)  
h1= base + geom_histogram(aes(x = value),
                          binwidth = WIDTH,
                          fill='grey') 
h1=h1 + labs(y="Count") + labs(x="Life Expectancy")
h1
```

```{r}
mn=Mean(cia$value,na.rm = T)
sk=Skew(cia$value,
     na.rm = T)

annMean=paste0('Mean:',round(mn))
annSk=paste0('Skewness:',round(sk,2))

h2 = h1+ geom_vline(xintercept = mn,color='red') + 
    annotate(geom = 'text',color='red',
             label=annMean,
              y = 15,
              x=mn-3,
              angle=90) + 
    annotate(geom = 'text', color='blue',
             label=annSk,
              y = 5,
              x= 88,
              angle=0)

h2
```

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
